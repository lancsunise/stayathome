# Useful Readings

This chapter contains a collection of books and tutorials. They are divided in several topics. They are mostly a subset of books and tutorials that I am aware of. Computer Science is a wide area however, so consider contributing some of your favourite CS books/tutorials here. Read the chapter "Participation" to see how to contribute. Please note that some books will be available in the University's online library, whilst some won't. Where possible, books which are freely available are favoured.

## Programming Languages

Once you've learnt variables, if statements, loops and functions you can code pretty much anything you want. So, should you stop acquiring any extra programming knowledge? No. There is so much more with virtually any language to learn about. C++ has a reputation to be one of the most complicated languages out there. Why? Because the language is so rich in different concepts that there is almost always something new to learn. Java, C#, etc. are also rich languages so I'm almost certain that once you open one of the books below you will find something you didn't know. Without further ado, below are some books that may be useful to extend your knowledge.

### Java

+ Java: The Complete Reference by Herbert Schildt: as the title says, this book provides a detailed reference of all Java features. You should probably use this book to find relevant topics of your interest, rather than reading the whole book in one go.
+ Thinking in Java by Bruce Eckel: relatively famous book on Java, similar to the one above, but needs a new version. It's here mostly as a reference (though, don't make me stop you to have a look at it, writing is really good!)
+ Effective Java by Joshua Bloch: this is a more advanced book suggesting some good practices to consider when coding in Java.

### C/C++

+ The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie: in my opinion this is one of the most important programming books. It shows how things in computer science are not actually moving that quick. Yes, we can new things, but the main concepts remain.
+ C++ Primer by Josee Lajoie and Stanley B. Lippman: this book is virtually a reference book as well. It contains most of the modern C++ features and it is a pretty decent book to have in your collection if you're into C++.

### Other Languages

> Everyone has their favourite languages. If your favourite language isn't covered here, which book or tutorial did you follow to learn the language. Fancy sharing that with your peers? Jump to "Participation" to see how to contribute.

## Concurrency

+ Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz et al.: this is a Java oriented book, but describes concurrency related concepts which be applied across different languages
+ [Java Concurrency and Multithreading Tutorial](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/index.html): very detailed tutorial on concurrency in Java if you want to avoid a book.

## Object Oriented Programming

+ Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Gamma et al.: this book is a classic. Have you heard the phrase "Gang of Four"? Well, this is the book from the gang in question. Four authors who influenced OOP from the 90s onwards.
+ [Game Programming Patterns by Bob Nystrom](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/): in my opinion the best book to explain desing patterns in an interesting way + using many game examples. Very useful if you're on an SCC.210 module. The best of all, the online version is free. Also, each pattern is more or less self-contained so read only what you're interested in.

## General Software Engineering

+ Code Complete by Steve McConnell: a great book to learn how to improve your coding skills!
+ The Pragmatic Programmer by Hunt and Thomas: book which very well complements Code Complete. This book is another classic amongst software people.
+ Clean Code by Robert C. Martin: another great book that teaches you how to write good code - spoiler alert it has to do a lot with avoiding variable names such as l, m, z... So how to call variables, functions etc.? This is the book to look at.
+ Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin: once you can write clean code, you need to know how to structure it well. This book is a really good read for those who want to be software professionals.
+ Agile Estimating and Planning, by Mike Cohn: how do agile teams work? What is team's velocity? How to estimate the size of tasks? This book is a really good guide to understand agile development.
+ [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/): learn how modern applications are deployed nowadays.
+ [Jenkins Blue Ocean (Continous Integration)](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/): have a look at how companies manage their software lifecycle.
+ [Git workflow - trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/): a super useful tutorial on how to use version control systems effeciently

## Cryptography

+ Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications by Ferguson et al.: this book is probably a good start if you're interested in the field. It's comprehensive but still not too complicated.

## Data Science

+ Foundamentals of Data Visualisation by Claus O. Wilke: next time you generate graphs from your user study for SCC.210 (yes, again SCC.210, but also useful everywhere else where you need to present some graphs), first have a look at this book. This book will tell you precisely how to make graphs so that during the Q&A time you don't get a question what values are on the $x$-axis. This book is truly great and you can read it for free online!
+ Data Science from Scratch - First Principles with Python: many books teach concepts and then they apply those concepts using some existing solutions. This book is different. It goes through most concepts from scratch - i.e. by implementing some basic operations such as variance, covariance, correlation, etc. An interesting read for sure.

## Machine Learning

+ Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques by Hall et al.: there are too many books on machine learning that it's difficult to choose which to list. This book is from University of Waikato academics who also created a tool called Weka (try to guess where Waikato is...). Anyhow, I believe this book gives a good foundation for machine learning and you can also practice your knowledge in Weka (which requires no coding).
+ Foundations of Machine Learning by Mohri et al.: the big benefit of this book is that it's free! It also covers very many machine learning concepts. You should totally try it.
+ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions): famous platform for machine learning competitions. There is one very relevant challenge going on there, which is the call for [help to better understand Covid-19](https://www.kaggle.com/covid19).

## Graphics

+ [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/): this tutorial should give you a head start into computer graphics. There is also an offline PDF version of the tutorials freely available.
+ [Start making a 2D game](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/): alternative: [libgdx (Java)](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki)
+ [Start making a 3D game](https://learn.unity.com/tutorials): alternative: [jMonkeyEngine (Java)](https://jmonkeyengine.org/docs/), [Unreal Engine (C++)](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/SiteIndex/index.html?versions=4_9)

## Biographies

+ Founders at Work by Jessica Livingston: OK, perhaps not a biography in a traditional sense of the word, but if you're interested on how many software companies started (e.g. Yahoo, Flickr, TripAdvisor) this book is for you. It contains a collection of interviews with founders of many software companies.
