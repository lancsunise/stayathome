# Interesting CS Facts

1. Linus Torvalds developed the first version of Linux when he was roughly your age. Read his [first email](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.os.minix/dlNtH7RRrGA/SwRavCzVE7gJ) where he announced Linux.

2. We don't hear often about Claude Shannon, but his [article](https://web.archive.org/web/19980715013250/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf) is the founding work of the field of information theory. Maybe you've heard about the _information entropy_ - that's from Shannon's work. One very useful application of the information entropy is loseless compression.

3. The term "software engineering" was coined by Margaret Hamilton, who is one of the first computer programmers. She was director of the software engineering at MIT which developed on-board flight software for [NASA's Apollo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)).

4. HP, Microsoft and Apple have one very interesting thing in common â€“ they were all started in a garage.

5. This one is a bit controversial (so perhaps not a fact). Object oriented (OO) languages are all about the four primary features: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. But are they really? See what [Uncle Bob](https://youtu.be/QHnLmvDxGTY?t=2059) thinks about OO.

6. It is estimated that Google consumes the energy of [200,000 households](https://business.directenergy.com/blog/2017/november/powering-a-google-search) each year. And all this in order to index less than 1% of the information available on the Internet.

7. Only [8%](https://money.howstuffworks.com/currency.htm) of the world's currency is physical money, the rest is on computers.

8. The video game industry [has sales greater](https://www.econotimes.com/The-Gaming-Industry-Is-Now-Bigger-Than-Hollywood-1558784) than Hollywood box office sales.
