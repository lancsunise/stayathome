# Why This Booklet?

The core reason for this booklet is the disturbance caused by the Covid pandemic. As the lockdown has led to cancelling exams, we hoped that the time you would have used to prepare for exams could be used somewhere else. This booklet is a compilation of interesting computer science (CS) challenges, readings and facts. It's meant to be informative and give you some directions for filing your free time for the rest of this term. Through some CS challenges, the aim of this booklet is to also engage you to be active on a dedicated Moodle forum. The dedicated forum is available in the general discussion section of your respective year (e.g. UG Second Year 19/20). Feel free to join in and discuss any parts of this booklet. Or even better, feel free to share any interesting (CS) challenges, news, facts, interesting ideas, etc. that you might come across and think are worth mentioning or solving.

This booklet has been prepared for all undergraduate students. So, you may come across something you haven't learnt yet. No worries, if you are interested enough you can search for keywords mentioned in this document. On the other hand, if you are a final year student you may find some parts easy. In this case, follow the references in this document to learn some new skills. At the end of the day, everyone should hopefully find some useful references/ideas to keep themselves busy during the rest of this term.
